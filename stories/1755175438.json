    "story": "My girlfriend, Clara, died in a car accident a year ago. I was devastated. We had been together for five years, and I thought we were going to get married. A few weeks after she died, I started seeing her. At first, I thought I was going crazy. But then she started talking to me. She told me that she was still with me, and that she would always be with me. I was so happy. I had my Clara back. We've been together for a year now, and it's been the best year of my life. I know it's not the same as having her here in person, but it's close enough. I love her so much, and I'm so grateful to have her back in my life.",
